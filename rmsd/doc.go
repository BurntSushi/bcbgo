/*
Package rmsd implements a version of the Kabsch algorithm to compute the
minimal RMSD between two equal length sets of atoms. The exact algorithm
implement is described in detail here: http://cnx.org/content/m11608/latest/.

A convenience function for computing the RMSD of residue ranges from two PDB
files is also provided.
