bcbgo is a repository that contains a number of connected packages for 
performing research in computational biology.

Packages
========
pdb
---
Package pdb includes support for gathering some information from PDB files.
Currently, this information is limited to primary amino acid sequence, and the
start and stop residue indices of ATOM records for each chain.

matt
----
Package matt is a wrapper around the structural aligner that we all know and 
love. It's meant to provide a sane configuration interface for calling matt.

The package will also support the ability to query details about the alignment 
easily, such as fetching the core RMSD. Currently, there are no facilities to 
examine other output (such as the alignment itself).

fragbag
-------
Package fragbag uses matt to compute a vector of fragments corresponding to a 
fragment library by picking the best matching fragment for each overlapping and 
contiguous kmer in the input.

fragbag also provides types and methods for dealing with fragbag's fragment
libraries.

hhfrag
------
Package hhfrag is a wrapper around the HHfrag and hhsuite tools that takes as 
input a sequence and returns a list of fragments that correspond to lists of 
PDB ATOM records.
