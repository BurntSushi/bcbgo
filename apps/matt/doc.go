/*
Package matt provides a relatively bare bones blackbox for running Matt and
easily gathering results like RMSD, core length and a p-value.

This package also provides RunAll which can be used to run many matt instances
in parallel.

Please see the 'rmsd' example in the examples directory for a full and complete
working example using three samples from the PDB.

Matt is available on the web: http://matt.cs.tufts.edu/
